## Introduction
Qualitative research often involves analyzing large volumes of unstructured data, such as interviews, focus groups, and open-ended survey responses. AI technologies, particularly natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, can significantly enhance the efficiency and depth of qualitative analysis. This repository includes:
- An example of using AI for the analysis of participant answers to scenario questions and following up safety questions.
- Python code for creating open codes from qualitative data.
- Guidelines for integrating AI tools into qualitative research workflows.
